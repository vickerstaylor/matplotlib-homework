# matplotlib Homework Analysis

Here are 3 trends I've analyzed looking at the graphs in the Pyber homework:

1. The more drivers present in the city type tends to drive the average price down. This is prevalent in the bubble chart where Rural average fares are higher but there are less drivers. The competition is good for consumers.

2. Urban cities where the population is most certainly higher, use public transportation more frequently. This is obvious across all of the graphs where the Urban cities are such large portions of the overall percentages.

3. Due to the distance between points of interest, it would make sense that Rural ride share is much less common due to the price and availability of drivers. This is obvious across all of the graphs. It would make much more sense to do your own driving the further out of the city you are.
